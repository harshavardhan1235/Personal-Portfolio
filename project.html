            <p><br>Objective:<br>
                The primary goal of this project was to create a functional event calendar application using C++. The application was designed to help users keep track of events and important dates efficiently.
                
                <br><br>Features:<br>
                <br>Add Event:<br> Users could add events with details such as the event name, date, time, and description.
                <br>Delete Event:<br> Functionality to delete events that are no longer needed.
                <br>Edit Event:<br> Users could edit the details of an existing event.
                <br>View Events:<br> Display all events on a particular date or within a date range.
                <br>Search Events:<br> Search for events based on keywords or dates.
                <br><br>Technologies Used:<br>
                <br>Programming Language:<br> C++
                <br>Data Storage:<br> The application used file handling for storing event data persistently. Events were saved in a file, which could be read and modified as needed.
                <br><br>Key Concepts:<br>
                <br>File Handling:<br> For reading from and writing to files to ensure data persistence.
                <br>Classes and Objects:<br> Utilized object-oriented programming concepts for structuring the application.
                <br>Data Structures:<br> Used appropriate data structures such as arrays or linked lists to manage the events efficiently.
                <br><br>Challenges:<br>
                <br>File Handling Complexity:<br> Ensuring data integrity during read/write operations.
                <br>User Interface:<br> Creating a simple and intuitive console-based user interface.
                <br>Error Handling:<br> Implementing robust error handling to manage invalid inputs and file operation errors.
                <br><br>Outcome:<br>
                The project successfully demonstrated the use of C++ for developing a real-world application. It provided hands-on experience in file handling, object-oriented programming, and basic data structure manipulation, laying a strong foundation for future software development endeavors.</p>
